TO INSTALL THE DEVELOPMENT DOCKER STACK INCLUDED WITH THIS SOFTWARE
===================================================================

* Install and configure Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your system - if it is already
    installed, skip this step.
* Install the Symbiota template files as follows:
    a. Layout - header.php and footer.php are used by all pages to establish
        uniform layout. menu.php is needed if a left menu is preferred.
        Within the base installation folder, rename header_template.php and
        footer_template.php to remove _template from file name.
        * header.php: Within file, change /images/layout/defaultheader.jpg
        to /images/layout/header.jpg. Add your header to /images/layout/
        folder. Change /images/layout/defaultleftstrip.gif as desired.
        Establishing the header using an image is easy, yet more
        complex header configurations are possible.
        * footer.php: modify as you did with header.php file.
    b. Files for style control - Go to /css/ and
        rename main_template.css, speciesprofile_template.css, and jquery-ui_template.css files
        removing _template from file names. Modify main.css and speciesprofile.css files to match
        desired style and layout for all pages.
* Install the Symbiota configuration files as follows:
    a. Copy config/dbconnection_docker_dev_stack.php to config/dbconnection.php
    b. Copy config/symbini_docker_dev_stack.php to config/symbini.php
    c. In the config/symbini.php file, set the $DEFAULT_TITLE and $ADMIN_EMAIL variables to fit your
        preference
* Start the Docker development stack:
    a. Start the Docker CLI on your system (if it is not already running)
    b. Navigate to the root directory of this Symbiota installation
    c. Run: docker-compose up -d
    d. The first time the development stack is started it will take longer to start as both of the
        docker images are built
* Once the development stack is running, use a database management application (such as MySQL Workbench)
    to connect to your database container using the following parameters:
        Host: localhost:3308
        Username: root
        Password: password
* Install the database schema in the Symbiota database that had already been created in your container
    through the following steps:
    a. Load databse schema from scripts. Schema definition files are
        located in <SymbiotaBaseFolder>/config/schema-1.0/utf-8/. By default,
        the database is assumed to be configured to a UTF8 character set.
        Run db_schema-1.0.sql to install the core table structure.
        From MySQL commandline: source /BaseFolderPath/config/schema-1.0/utf-8/db_schema-1.0.sql
    b. Run database patch scripts to bring database up to current structure.
        Make sure to run the scripts in the correct order
        (e.g. db_schema_patch_1.0.1.sql, db_schema_patch_1.0.2.sql, etc)
* The data files of your database will be stored in the data directory of your Symbiota installation. This
    directory can be used to back up your database or transfer it to another system.
* Your Symbiota stack is now configured and running. You can access it through at browser at:
    http://localhost
* To shut down your docker development stack navigate to the root directory of this Symbiota installation
    and run: docker-compose down
* To restart the stack simply follow the instructions to Start the Docker development stack above.

Enjoy!
