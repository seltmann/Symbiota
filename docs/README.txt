ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
===================

The Symbiota Software Project is building a library of webtools to 
aid biologists in establishing specimen-based virtual floras and 
faunas. This project developed from the realization that complex, 
information-rich biodiversity portals are best built through 
collaborative efforts between software developers, biologists, 
wildlife managers, and citizen scientists. The central premise 
of this open source software project is that, through a partnership 
between software engineers and the scientific community, higher quality 
and more publicly useful biodiversity portals can be built. An 
open source software framework allows technicians to create 
the tools thus freeing the biologist to concentrate their efforts 
on the curation of quality datasets. In this manner, we can create 
something far greater than a single entity can achieve alone.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================ 

Symbiota has been generously funded by the National Science 
Foundation (DBI-0743827) from 15 July 2008 to 30 June 2011 
(Estimated). The Global Institute of Sustainability 
(GIOS) at Arizona State University has also been a major 
supporter of the Symbiota initiative since the very beginning. 
Arizona State University Vascular Plant and Lichen Herbarium have 
been intricately involved in the development from the start. 
Sky Island Alliance and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum have both 
been long-term participants in the development of this product.

DEVELOPER GUIDELINES
====================

Anyone willing to collaborate is welcome. Please review issues and open a pull request at https://github.com/Symbiota/Symbiota or contact the authors 
about your plans:

* Class properties are always manipulated through accessors and mutators.
* Give preference to longer and clearer variable, function and class 
  names.
